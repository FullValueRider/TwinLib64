# Twin64Lib
 
This is a project that started with me trying to put together some classes to help remove boilerplate from answers to advent of code.  It started as a C# library, which was a bit scary as at the time I'd never written any C# code.  With the advent of twin basic I've reimplemented the c# code in VBA and added lots more funmctionality.  The introduction of twin Basic has allowed a simpler approach to providing an activex library for VBA use so I've moved the VBA code into twinbasic and am slowly refactoring to use the newer features offered by twinBasic.

This library is, of course, a never ending project
